# note-taking-app-python

s part of my coding journey, I built a functional terminal-based Note-Taking Application in Python.
This project helped me improve my understanding of:

File Handling (reading, writing, and deleting data)

Functions for clean, reusable code

Loops for continuous menu navigation

Error Handling to avoid crashes

User Input Validation for better user experience

Features:
âœ… Add Notes ðŸ“Œ
âœ… View Notes ðŸ“–
âœ… Delete Notes ðŸ—‘
âœ… Exit Anytime ðŸšª
